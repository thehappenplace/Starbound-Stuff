# Mod Readme
Hey So if you got here there must be something that you like or that caught your eye
Nothing big just two snakes that you can spawn in.

**THis Requires the StarboundSimpleVoreMod by sheights** 

found below
https://github.com/Sheights/StarboundSimpleVoreMod

**Install**

Coppy the folder to your mod folder located in the starbound game folder
Do not nest the folder so it should be Starbound/mods/Modfoldernamehere/ not Starbound/mods/Extrafolder/ModFoldername <-bad


**INFO**

They have the same spawn setup: 1 door, 1 Light, 6 floran, 1 Vore badge, Colony deed

They only have the one version and it does not digest.

Each have multi stage swallow anim and allow the user to essentially "escape" the pred.  You can spam interact to get out if needed.
They also allow interaction from outside players to convince the snake to let their prey go.
If you stay too long you will be trapped in the snake until you die (hunger or killed) or convince them to let you out -> this is an instant release.
As you go deeper the chance of escape gets harder :3

Anyway these have been on my hard drive forever and just wanted to upload something to test out the site
